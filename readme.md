# Introduction

- Adding all the exersises which I do while learning Hyperledger Fabric v2.2
- baiscs-101 and basics-102 directories contains trimmed versions of [fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-2.2) for JavaScript version of Chaincode. The purpose here is just to start the default network and take an overview that how fabric works
- From directory basics-103, one by one concepts are covered
- For rest of the learning exercise i.e. basics-1xx, I will refer bin folder which is parallel to other basic-1xx directories
